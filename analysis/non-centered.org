* Introduction

  We are interested in fitting generalized linear models by estimating a
  posterior over regression coefficients, assuming a model:

  \[ p(x, y, \theta, \cdot) = p(y \mid x, \theta) p(\theta \mid \cdot) \]

  Leaving aside the likelihood \(p(y \mid x, \theta)\), one powerful prior is
  the spike-and-slab prior (George and McCullough 1999):

  \[ p(\theta_j \mid \cdot) = \pi_0 \delta_0(\theta_j) + (1 - \pi_0) N(\theta_j; 0, \tau^{-1}) \]

  We (Park et al 2017) and others (Carbonetto and Stephens 2012) have
  previously applied variational inference to fit this model, assuming a
  conjugate approximating family:

  \[ q(\theta_j \mid \cdot) = \alpha_j \delta_0(\theta_j) + (1 - \alpha_j) N(\theta_j;
  \beta_j, \gamma_j^{-1}) \]

  This method works well; however, one challenge is estimating the
  hyperparameters \(\pi, \tau\). We previously developed a variational method
  which would simultaneously perform approximate Bayesian inference on the
  hyperparameters:

  \[ \rho = \ln\left(\frac{\pi_0}{1 - \pi_0}\right) \]

  \[ p(\rho) = N(\rho; 0, 1) \]

  \[ p(\tau) = N(\tau; 0, 1) \]

  \[ q(\rho \mid \cdot) = N(\rho; m_\rho, p_\rho^{-1}) \]

  \[ q(\tau \mid \cdot) = N(\tau; m_\tau, p_\tau^{-1}) \]
  
  In this parameterization, the evidence lower bound (ELBO) is not analytic:

  \[ ELBO = E_q[\ln p(y \mid x, \theta)] - E_{q(\tau)} \left[KL\left(q(\theta) \Vert
  p(\theta) \right)\right] - E_{q(\pi)}\left[KL\left(q(z) \Vert
  p(z)\right)\right] - KL(q(\rho)\Vert p(\rho)) - KL(q(\tau) \Vert p(\tau)) \]

  Instead, we have to use the reparameterization trick to estimate gradients
  and optimize the ELBO via gradient descent.

  Further, the hyperparameters \(\rho, \tau\) are tightly coupled, as
  previously observed (Zhou, Carbonetto, and Stephens 2013). This could lead
  the empirically observed properties where the algorithm sometimes fails to
  escape the degenerate solution \(\theta \rightarrow 0, \pi_0 \rightarrow 1\).

  We could partially address these problems by using a non-centered
  parameterization of the prior:

  \[ \theta_j = \tau^{-1} \tilde\theta_j z_j \]

  \[ p(\tilde\theta_j) = N(0, 1) \]

  Here, we investigate the properties of variational inference against this
  parameterization.
